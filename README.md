<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

Whilst building the reproduction CPU/2, I found (not a surprise) that some of the parts are becoming increasingly rare and expensive to find. One clear example of this is the Intel 1702A EPROMs.

These chips are integral to the CPU/2 board, as they contain the “Operating System” for the whole computer.

Project ORB, then, is a project to allow these chips to be simulated, and therefore not require expensive replacement chips.

## Acknowledgments

I have to give my heartfelt thanks to Ben Zotto, who has been a sounding board for me throughout this project, answering my emails, and checking his Sphere-1 CPU/2 board to answer questions, and offering thoughts as to why things “were like they were” ! Without him, I would never have got as far as I have.
